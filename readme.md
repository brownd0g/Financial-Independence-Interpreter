==Financial Independance Interpreter (FII) version 1==

Author : Andrew Brown

The FII is used to interpret the data output from the FIT V.2.

All the user must do is open a file exported from the FIT V.2 using the file browser which is activated
by pressing the "open" button. It does not have to be specifically exported from FIT V.2 but must be of
the same format

The FII uses a function which starts by opening a file of the users choice. If the user does not select
a file of the right format, an error window will pop-up prompting the user to try again.

Once an appropriate file has been selected, the function will calculate the maximum, minimum and average
of all the final year balances of the simulations run in the previous FIT test. This is then displayed on
the screen.

The user may pick a new file at any time.
